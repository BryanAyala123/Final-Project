This is a bttleship game and I decided to creat this because I knew it was going to be a fun but difficult challenge for me. But in the end
Im really happy I did this because I created a fun game to play that I had lots of memeres playing with my sibling. And I made it so that you
can play it by yourself to pass the time. The function in the end really saved me alot of work not having to right the same turn. Also to check
if somone one before each turn, the game turned out fine and happy that I was able to finish.
